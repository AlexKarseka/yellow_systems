Technologies used in the project

Functional components were used to create the components. To retrieve json files from the API we used fetch, 
then the received data were exported to the APP root component. To work with data received from the server, 
the component used hooks useState and useEffect. To navigate the site, we used 'react-router-dom'.
Pagination was implemented in a custom way, when switching pages, a props with the right page number is sent 
to the fetch, so that the rendering takes place.To search the site used API, which passed the request. 
The request comes in through the useState and useEffect hooks and we get the page with the desired data.Also, 
when you click on a movie card (just on its title), a page opens with detailed information about the movie. 
The useParams hook is used to open a specific movie. Information with similar movies is available 
on this page. There is an option to add movies to favorites, when you click on the Favorites button, 
it pops up and the card with all the necessary information about the movie through the props goes to a 
separately created page with favorite movies, thanks to local staging the movie is saved after reloading 
the page. Unfortunately, I was not able to implement saving multiple objects in one array for favorites, 
so there will be only one movie available there(



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
